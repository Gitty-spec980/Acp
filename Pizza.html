        <p>Pizza is an Italian, specifically Neapolitan, dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based
        dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired
        oven.</p>
        
        <p>The term pizza was first recorded in 997 AD, in a Latin manuscript from the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, on
        the border with Campania. Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating the modern pizza in Naples.In
        2009, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) dish. In
        2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.</p>
        
        Pizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world. Pizza is sold at a variety of restaurants,
        including pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants), Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery, and as street food.[9] In
        Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.In
        casual settings, however, it is typically cut into slices to be eaten while held in the hand. Pizza is also sold in
        grocery stores in a variety of forms, including frozen or as kits for self-assembly. Store-bought pizzas are then cooked
        using a home oven.
        
        <p>In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion; in the US, it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias.
        Overall, 13% of the US population aged two years and over consumed pizza on any given day.</p>
